# python vs. javascript
## topics
- data types
    - numbers (ints & floats)
    - strings
    - Booleans
    - arrays
    - tuples
- loops
- conditionals
- functions

| js | py |
| -- | -- |
|concatenates numbers and strings | only combines like data types|
| uses { } to block off functions | uses indentation to block off functions |

## Formatting fun
~~~ py
my_list = [3, 5, 6, 7]
def function_name():
    this is a function block that uses color coding
    range(len(my_list))
~~~

_Italicize_  
*Also italcize*  
**bold**

to have a line break, end line with 2 spaces and then hit return  
there is slightly more spacing if you hit return twice

as shown by the gaps above

## numbers

Ints and float
- 35 vs. 35.0

## strings
~~~ py
first_name = "Adrian"
last_name = "Dowst"
age = 40
~~~

original way to embed variables into a string
~~~py
print("Hi my name is %s %s and I am %d years old" % (first_name, last_name, age))
~~~
next approach was
~~~py
print("Hi my name is {} {} and I am {} years old".format(first_name, last_name, age))
~~~
current approach
~~~py
print(f"Hi my name is {first_name} {last_name} and I am {age} years old.")
~~~


## Booleans

True & False  
(must be capitalized)

True can also be 1 or object exists  
False can also be 0 or object doesn't exist

## Lists (called arrays in JS)

have [ ]  
accessed via index number (zero-based)  
many built in functions

## Dictionary (called objects in JS)

enclosed in { }  
keys must be in quotes (unlike in JS)  
values are after the  :

## tuples

definited by ( ) and are immutable

## for loops in python

The easiest way to do a for loop
~~~py
brothers = ["tyler", "curtis", "joe" ]
for brother in brothers:
    print(brother)
~~~

another way to run (but requires more functions)
~~~py
for index in range(len(brothers)):
    brother = brothers[index]
    print brother
~~~

range(start, stop, step)

## While loops in python

~~~py
count = 0
while (i < len(brothers)>):
    print(brothers)
    count +=1
~~~

Can't use i++ in python

## functions

once you have a default paramenter in a function, everything to its right should also have a default

similarly, everything to the right of the first named argument should also be named
